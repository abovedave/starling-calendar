# Starling Calendar Feed

This will create a calendar feed of your [Starling](https://www.starlingbank.com/) Standing Orders and Direct Debits using the [offical API](https://developer.starlingbank.com/docs).

## Setup

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

Pass your [personal access token](https://developer.starlingbank.com/docs#developing-applications-temp) as a query string `?personalToken`

## Limitations

Upcoming Direct Debits do not seem to be communicated in the API as they are in the app.
